## __Introduction__

### _Terminology_

The term __Inkosi__ could sounds a little bit _weird_, indeed, it is actually coming from the _Zulu_ vocabulary, and it means __King__ or __Chief__ in _English_.

### _Inspiration_
The choice was inspired by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), a _container orchestration system_ (It does completely different things).
<br>
I just wanted to create a platform based on __multiservices__ in order to _simplify_, _accelerate_ and _streamline_ the Financial Institution __daily activies__.

### _Definition_
The _project_ aims to offer an __Algorithmic Trading Platform__, the idea is not meant to develop a trading strategy but, to build a _reliable_, _efficient_ and _maintainable_ __solution__ to __open__ and __close__ positions accordingly to algorithmic or manual trading signals, __backtest__ your algorithmic trading strategies, __manage__ commissions for all you investors, __infer__ on the markets, __manage__ risk efficiently, ...
<br>
<br>
As shown below, the __platform__ has been _structured_ to serve __financial institution__ which generally follow the presented __pattern__:

- __Investment Firm__
    - A financial institution that __manages__ and __invests__ money _on behalf of_ individuals or organisations, with the __objective__ of _generating financial returns_.
- __Funds__
    - All the money __collected__ through an _initial campaign_ of the Investment Firm are distributed and assigned to __different funds__ according to __different features__ such as:
        - __Liquidity__
        - __Asset__
        - __Investment Objectives__
        - ...
- __Portfolio Manager__ (Numerous and various assigned to different funds)
    - He is a _financial professional_ or an _entity responsible_ for managing an investment portfolio on behalf of __funds__
    - For each __funds__ are generally assigned a __different number of portfolio managers__ in accordance with their _prior_ experiences, _financial_ knowledge, etc.
- __ATS__ (Algorithmic Trading Strategies)
    - A simple application able to send __trading signals__ to the main platform accordingly to strategies based on an __empirical approach__, __machine learning models__, etc.

### _Definition_

It is a __OMS__ (Order Management System) written in _Python_ which interacts, through the __MetaTrader 5__ library, with the MetaTrader 5 Client.
<br>
The project aims to offers a __solid__ and __reliable__ _infrastructure_ able to quickly __open__ and __close__ trading positions.

### _General Information_

At the state of art, the __platform__ could only interacts with markets on __Windows__, due to _MetaTrader API_.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Currenty, it is a platform widely used by __different brokers__, and it is also free to use compared to __Trader Workstation__. In the future, I would really like to implement __TWS API__ (_Trader WorkStation API_ to render Inkosi __versatile__)
<br>
<br>
_I apologise for the_ __incovenience__.


### _Advanced Python Programming For Economics, Management And Finance Exam_

At the moment a __Compute Engine__ instance, a simple virtual machine running on __Microsoft Server 2022__, here are contained all the needed tools (expect from MetaTrader 5) to interact with the platform.
<br><br>

__Tools__:

- _Visual Studio Code_
    - Here the _latest version_ of the code has been loaded, you will be able to have a closer look to it
- _Postman_
    - Postman is an API platform for developers
    - All the __API Endpoints__ are available on this platform, divided by features
- _Mongo Compass_
    - __Compass__ is a _free interactive_ tool for _querying_, _optimizing_, and _analyzing_ MongoDB data

- _Google Chrome_
    - Most widely used internet browser
    - You will have access to _Frontend experiences_

All the information needed to use the _Virtual Machine_ have been inserted in the __README.txt__ file of the uploaded folder.
<br><br>
Two __databases__ have been created to _respectively_ interact to __PostgreSQL__ and __MongoDB__ (Access only available through the Virtual Machine, IP Address restriction has been implemented. Credentials avaiable in the _uploaded folder_ on __BlackBoard__)
