## MongoDB

### _Introduction_

Currently, the __MongoDB__ _instance_ is necessary to save all the information relatively to _Trades_ and _Logs_, as could be seen from <span style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:3px;">config.yaml</span>.

Here, you will find all the information regarding _schemas_ and _models_, and part of the __database__ _modules_. The rest is directly available on the code, there are methods of the __MongoDBCrud__, that are used to answer all the __different endpoints__ _available_.
